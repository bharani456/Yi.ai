              India, with the largest youth population in the world, houses several young
              entrepreneurial minds. <strong>Yi Entrepreneurship</strong> creates a platform for
              <strong> knowledge delivery, mentorship, and market access</strong> to enable entrepreneurs
              to scale and inspire the youth on their path of entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yi recognizes entrepreneurship as a key element of transformation for India heading into the
              next decade of growth. It creates not only <strong>economic value</strong> but also
              <strong> job opportunities</strong>, solving challenges that hinder India's full potential.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yi envisions an environment that promotes entrepreneurship as a tool to develop India. This
              is achieved through <strong>structured mentorship, workshops, and internships</strong> for
              college students, and also by fostering an entrepreneurial mindset from an early age
              in schools.
