             Yi ensures to hone the leadership skills of its members with several learning
              programs throughout the year, from interactive sessions to talks with national
              and global leaders to company and industry visits in India and overseas.
            </p>

            <p>
             One of the oldest and perhaps most important verticals in Yi, the <strong> Learning Vertical</strong> , as the name implies, 
             has traditionally served as a platform for Yi members to 
             learn from the best; through interactive sessions, company visits, workshops, seminars, and from peers in the organisation.
            </p>

            <p>Learning activities across India have included:</p>

              Yi has become a platform that attracts industry stalwarts to share their knowledge. However, learning is often limited to those present and can be transient.
